## What is JustThreed?

JustThreed connects Blender to any AI model through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Just describe what you want in plain English and watch it appear in Blender — no scripting, no manual clicking, no prior Blender experience needed.

```
"Create a low poly cabin in the woods with warm lighting"
"Add a stone texture to the ground plane"
"Render the scene from a top-down angle"
"Create 10 random trees scattered around the scene"
```

## How it works

```
AI Client (Claude / Gemini / Cursor / Ollama / etc.)
       ↓
JustThreed MCP Server (server.py) — translates intent to commands
       ↓
Blender Addon (addon.py) — socket server on port 9876
       ↓
Blender (bpy API) — executes in real time
```

The Blender addon opens a TCP socket and waits for commands. The MCP server sits between your AI client and Blender, exposing tools that any AI model can call. When you type a prompt, the AI decides which tools to use and in what order, and Blender executes them instantly.

---

## Local setup

> This is the current install path. Once JustThreed is published to the Blender Extensions platform, a one-click install will be available — see [Blender Extension — coming soon](#blender-extension--coming-soon) below.

### Step 0 — How the MCP server is installed (you probably don't need to do anything)

The JustThreed MCP server is [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/justthreed/). When you configure your AI client in Step 4, the `uvx justthreed` command automatically downloads and runs it from PyPI — no manual `pip install` needed.

If you prefer a manual install for any reason:

```bash
pip install justthreed
```

Then replace `"command": "uvx"` with `"command": "justthreed"` in the AI client configs below.

### Step 1 — Install uv

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2 — Install the Blender addon

1. Download `addon.py` from this repository
2. Open Blender → **Edit** → **Preferences** → **Add-ons**
3. Click **Install from Disk** and select `addon.py`
4. Enable the addon by ticking the checkbox next to **Interface: JustThreed**

### Step 3 — Start the MCP socket server in Blender

> ⚠️ **This is a manual step, and you have to do it every single time you open Blender.** JustThreed's Blender addon opens a TCP socket on `localhost:9876` that your AI client talks to. The socket is **not** started automatically when Blender launches — you have to click the button each time. If you skip this step, your AI client will still register the JustThreed MCP server fine (no config error), but every tool call will fail with a "connection refused" error because nothing is actually listening on port 9876. This is the single most common "it was working yesterday, why isn't it working today?" cause.

**To start it:**

1. In Blender, press **N** in the 3D viewport to open the right-hand side panel
2. Click the **JustThreed** tab
3. Click **Start MCP Server**
4. Watch Blender's system console for the message `JustThreed MCP Server started on port 9876`. The system console is hidden by default — on Windows, enable it via **Window → Toggle System Console**; on macOS and Linux, launch Blender from a terminal (`/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender` on macOS) so console output goes to that terminal.

**To verify from outside Blender** (useful when troubleshooting a stuck setup):

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:9876
```

If you see a line mentioning `Blender` with `LISTEN`, the socket is live and your AI client can talk to it. If the command returns nothing, the server is not running — go back to step 1. The check works identically on macOS and Linux; on Windows use `netstat -ano | findstr :9876`.

**To stop it:** click **Stop MCP Server** in the same panel, or just quit Blender — the socket is cleaned up automatically on exit.

**Every new Blender session requires repeating these steps.** There is no "start on launch" option yet — auto-start is a tracked feature request on the [Roadmap](#contributing), and a good first contribution for anyone wanting to help out. Until then: open Blender → click Start MCP Server → *then* launch your AI client.

### Step 4 — Connect your AI client

Pick your preferred AI client below:

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Go to **Claude → Settings → Developer → Edit Config** and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justthreed": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["justthreed"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You will see a hammer icon confirming the connection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (CLI)</b></summary>

> **Before you run these commands:** Blender must be open, the JustThreed addon enabled, and the MCP socket server started from the sidebar (Step 3 above). Claude Code talks to JustThreed, which talks to Blender via a local socket — if Blender's socket isn't listening on port 9876 you'll see connection errors no matter how the client is configured.

**1. Register JustThreed as a user-scoped MCP server** (available in every project, not just one):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user justthreed -- uvx justthreed
```

Alternatively, to scope it to a single project, create `.mcp.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justthreed": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["justthreed"]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Verify registration** (in any terminal, no `claude` session needed):

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see a line like `justthreed: uvx justthreed - ✓ Connected`. If it says `✗ Failed` or `Needs authentication`, go back and start the socket server inside Blender.

**3. Restart any running Claude Code session.** ⚠️ This is the step most people miss — **MCP servers are loaded once at session startup**, so if you already had `claude` running when you ran `mcp add`, the new server is registered but not active in that session. Exit with `/exit` and relaunch. Inside the fresh session, run `/mcp` to see the JustThreed tools listed.

Claude Code chains tool calls aggressively, so you can usually build an entire scene in a single prompt — see the [Limitations](#limitations) section for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / VSCode</b></summary>

Open your MCP settings file and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justthreed": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["justthreed"]
    }
  }
}
```

In Cursor, also raise **Settings → Features → Chat → Max tool calls per request** to 50–100 so it doesn't stop mid-build.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b></summary>

> **Before you start:** Blender must be open with the JustThreed addon enabled and the MCP socket server started from the sidebar (Step 3 above). If port 9876 isn't listening inside Blender, Gemini CLI will connect to JustThreed but every tool call will fail with a socket error.

1. Install Gemini CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   ```
2. Edit `~/.gemini/settings.json` and add the `mcpServers` block (merge it with whatever is already in the file — don't overwrite the existing keys):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "justthreed": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["justthreed"],
         "timeout": 60000
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Launch `gemini` in a fresh terminal.
4. Inside the CLI, run `/mcp` — you should see `justthreed` listed as `CONNECTED` with all of JustThreed's tools.

> ⚠️ **Important — Gemini chains tool calls differently than Claude. Read this before your first prompt.**
>
> If you paste a multi-step prompt like *"create a cube, add a material, add a light, add a camera, and render"*, **Gemini will run the first tool and then stop**, waiting for you to confirm before calling the next one. This is not a bug and not a JustThreed problem — it is how Gemini CLI's tool-use policy works by default. Claude Desktop, by contrast, chains the whole plan in a single turn, which is why the same prompt feels "instant" in Claude and "stuck" in Gemini.
>
> You have three ways to fix it — pick whichever fits your workflow:
>
> **1. Tell Gemini to keep going.** Reply with a single sentence like:
> ```
> Proceed with the remaining steps without pausing for confirmation.
> If any step fails, report the error and continue with the next one.
> ```
>
> **2. Turn on YOLO mode (auto-approve every tool call).** Inside the CLI type `/yolo`, or launch with `gemini --yolo`. Safe for JustThreed because every operation is undoable in Blender with `Ctrl+Z` and the MCP server is local-only — just remember to turn it off when you're using other MCP servers that touch the internet.
>
> **3. Send smaller batched prompts.** Instead of one 13-step mega-prompt, break it into 3–4 checkpoints (shape → materials → lighting → render). This plays to Gemini's natural one-step-at-a-time rhythm and gives you an inspection point after each stage.
>
> **The tools themselves behave identically under both Claude and Gemini** — the only difference is how many of them the client is willing to fire before checking in with you. Once you know the three fixes above, Gemini works end-to-end with every scenario JustThreed supports.

## Limitations

### Tool-call limits per AI client — read this before your first complex scene

> It is the single biggest source of "why did it stop halfway?" confusion for new users, and it applies to **every** AI client, not just JustThreed.

Every AI client that speaks MCP has a practical limit on **how many tools it can call inside a single conversational turn** before it pauses and checks in with you. This is not a JustThreed limit — it is part of each client's tool-use policy. It matters because a finished product render often needs **15 to 40 tool calls** (scene info, primitives, modifiers, materials, shader nodes, lighting, camera, render settings, compositor, render_and_show, …).

**What you will see per client:**

| Client | Type | Typical per-turn tool-call budget | Default behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Desktop** | Chat app | ~10–25 tool calls, then pauses | Fires a batch, summarizes progress, asks "should I continue?". The hardest per-turn cap of any client — feels the most "stuck" on big scenes. |
| **Claude Code (CLI)** | Terminal agent | ~100+ tool calls per turn, effectively context-bound | Chains aggressively until the task is done or the context window fills. Rarely pauses mid-build. The most hands-off option for long scenes. |
| **Gemini CLI** | Terminal agent | 1 tool call, then pauses | Runs the **first** tool and stops, waiting for confirmation. This is a policy default, not a hard limit. Use `/yolo` mode or the "proceed" instruction above to unlock full chaining. |
| **Cursor** | IDE | ~25 tool calls per request (configurable) | Setting: `Cursor Settings → Features → Chat → Max tool calls per request`. Raise it to 50–100 for JustThreed. |
| **VSCode + Copilot Chat / Continue** | IDE | Varies | Some chain freely, some pause per tool. Check your extension's agent-mode settings. |
| **Ollama / local MCP clients** | Local | No remote limit | Only bounded by your local model's context window. Smaller local models (7B–13B) often forget mid-plan and need smaller prompts regardless. |

#### CLI vs desktop — the short version

**CLI clients have way more headroom than desktop chat apps.** Claude Code in the terminal and Gemini CLI (once `/yolo` is on) will happily fire 50–100+ JustThreed tools in a single turn without asking — more than enough for a fully-lit, fully-materialed hero render in one prompt. Claude Desktop, by contrast, almost always pauses before you get there.

**But "CLI = no limits" is not quite true.** Even CLI agents eventually hit:

- **Context window limits** — every tool call and its result consume tokens. On a 200K context, you get roughly 80–150 JustThreed tool calls before the model starts forgetting earlier steps.
- **Per-turn iteration caps** — Claude Code has an internal cap (configurable) on how many tools it will run before yielding back to the user. It's high, but not infinite.
- **Rate limits on the provider side** — Anthropic and Google both throttle extremely long agentic runs on heavy usage.

**Practical rule of thumb for JustThreed:**

| If you use... | You can safely prompt... |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI | A full product render in one prompt (materials + lights + camera + render). |
| Gemini CLI with `/yolo` | Same — full scene in one prompt. |
| Claude Desktop | 2–3 stages per prompt. Use the "continue" pattern below when it pauses. |
| Cursor / VSCode | 2–3 stages per prompt unless you raise the max-tool-calls setting. |
| Ollama (local) | 1 stage per prompt. Local models lose focus faster than cloud models. |

**None of this blocks you from building anything** — it just means you work in **checkpoints** instead of one giant prompt. Three patterns below.

#### Pattern 1 — "Just keep going"

When the AI pauses mid-build, reply with one line:

```
Continue from where you left off. Call get_scene_info first so you
know exactly what is already in the scene, then keep going with the
remaining steps.
```

`get_scene_info` returns the **complete** scene state (every object, every material, every modifier, every collection), so the AI can pick up exactly where it stopped without guessing or repeating work. This pattern alone handles 90% of tool-limit pauses.

#### Pattern 2 — "Save and resume in a new chat"

For very long builds (40+ tool calls) or when you want to stop for the night and come back tomorrow, use `.blend` files as checkpoints. JustThreed's `save_blend_file` + `open_blend_file` pair is built for this — and because the extension registers a persistent load-post handler, **the MCP server survives file reloads**, so you can chain this indefinitely.

**Chat 1 — build the base, then save:**
```
Build the bronze spirits bottle described above. When you're done, call
save_blend_file with path "~/Desktop/bottle.blend".
```

**Chat 2 — fresh conversation, resume where you left off:**
```
Call open_blend_file with path "~/Desktop/bottle.blend", then
get_scene_info so you can see what's already built. Then add the
three-point lighting and render.
```

No tool-limit budget is wasted on re-creating anything — the new chat starts from the saved scene state.

#### Pattern 3 — "Break the prompt into stages" (the reliable default)

The most predictable way to build anything complex is to break the work into **3–5 stages**, one prompt per stage, each ending with a `render_and_show`. This avoids hitting any limits at all and **also gives you better results**, because seeing a mid-state render lets you catch mistakes early instead of after 40 tool calls of compounding errors.

**Typical staging for a hero product render:**

1. **Shape** — primitives + edit-mode modeling + modifiers → `render_and_show`
2. **Materials** — shader node graph, PBR, textures → `render_and_show`
3. **Lighting + camera** — studio preset, DoF, f-stop → `render_and_show`
4. **Render + post** — engine, samples, color management, compositor → final `render_and_show`

This is how professional Blender artists actually work anyway — lighting the scene before the materials are done is a waste of time. JustThreed just formalizes the rhythm.

#### The one-line takeaway

> **If the AI pauses mid-build, say *"continue — call get_scene_info first"*. If you are starting a big scene, break it into 3–5 stages and end each one with `render_and_show`. If you want to pick up tomorrow, `save_blend_file` tonight and `open_blend_file` tomorrow.**

### Other known limitations

- **Complex artistic judgment** (composition, style) still requires human input — the AI can execute, but it can't replace taste.
- **Very large scenes** may require breaking prompts into smaller steps (see the three patterns above).
- **`execute_code` runs arbitrary Python** — always save your work before using it.
- **Local models (Ollama)** are less capable than cloud models for complex tasks. Expect to hand-hold smaller models more than Claude / Gemini.
- **Not yet published** on the Blender Extensions platform — for now you install `addon.py` manually. See the "coming soon" section above.

---

## Requirements

- Blender 4.5.0 or newer (tested on 4.5.0 — should work on any later version)
- Python 3.11 or newer (bundled with Blender 4.5+)
- `uv` package manager
- One of the supported AI clients listed above
